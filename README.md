# Diagnostics-With-AWL
Self contained GNU AWK Scripts that shows you how to use GNU AWK to to diagnose network issues
Is a self contained app. The main idea with one tool emulate a web server but be as light as possible.
Its fairly east to use. 

  Please note the is strictly to a minimalist tool. Its meant to test the point of entry of initial contact of protocol.
  If you front end this tool with a tool similar to Socat toy can then proxy the connection using SSL. 
  
  The tool is almost complete and iot has plenty of examples.
  
  You can also use this tool to test firewall rules for accuracy even as a shy substitute for netcat or even nmap.
  
  This a real great with with protocols that "TP" as part of the name as most of these tools contain some component of
  a text based layer.
  
  Stand by more to come.
  
  Thanks Again
